//  Description: This app is used as a guide about how to configure your
//               delegate file with ERPN.swift API in order to send 
//               remote push notifications from your erpn server with IOS
//               devices. After building your own IOS project, and 
//               in order to send push notifications from your project 
//               using the ERPN, you must go to jortizsd.com/easy_remote_services/index.php
//               and create a new account. Then you must register your project,
//               follow the instructions detailed there, and set your delegate up 
//               like in this example.
//               Note: Your delegate file may look diferent from this one. However, you
//               should be able to set it up without any problem. Also, the following methods
//               didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken() and 
//               didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken()
//               will not appear as default methods when you create a project. You need to import
//               or type them manually.
//  
//  See:         ERPN API Docs
